    "In this notebook, I create my DataFrame and perform some basic analysis of crime reporting numbers to find the \"safest\" neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. Obviously, crime reports are simply not enough to say that a neighborhood is safe, since I won't be looking at what the offenses were. Some offenses are bound to be minor, while some will be pretty major crimes; these would both be worth the same value in this analysis. However, combined with Ola and Matthew's analyses and their metrics, I believe that crime statistics should help determine which neighborhoods would be good to live in. "

    "1. **South Side Flats** - 13972\n",
    "* This neighborhood sits on the south bank of the Monongahela River, almost directly south of the University of           Pittsburgh. It includes landmarks such as the Color Park and walking trails along the river. The neighborhood is also     centered around E Carson St, which has over 40 bars and pubs; this could be a contributing factor to high crime           reports. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Central Business District (aka Downtown)** - 12146\n",
    "* Downtown sits between the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers. Home to bars, skyscrapers, malls, good food and sports arenas, it is unsurprising that the business center of a historically industrial city is also home to high crime rates. This could also be due simply to the huge amount of traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, that the neighborhood attracts; more people will eventually lead to more crime. Downtown is often colloquially referred to as The Golden Triangle, which is included separately and has the 15th most UCR reports with 4278. Including this in the Central Business District's tally makes it the neighborhood with the most reports with 16,424, over 3,000 more than any other neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Carrick** - 8455\n",
    "* Everything after South Side Flats and Downtown has significantly fewer crime reports——at least 3700 fewer over the last 5 years. However, Carrick reported almost 2000 more crimes than the next highest, Bloomfield. Carrick sits on the South Side of Pittsburgh. As a densely packed neighborhood in an industrial city, it makes sense that it is a crime hotspot. Based on a quick Google search for \"Carrick Pittsburgh\" that immediately turned up articles from a few days ago (4/11) about a home invasion in which two men were assaulted. "

Although the neighborhood of Mt Oliver is  distinct from Mt Oliver Borough, I am considering them as one neighborhood (that technically isn't part of the city of Pittsburgh). It is a relatively high-end residential neighborhood. According to Wikipedia, the average household size is 2.36, which indicates that its residents are largely couples or single parents, with the occasional large family or person living alone. \n",

    "* A fair few of the safest neighborhoods are in far east (Swisshelm Park, New Homestead, Regent Square, Glen Hazel) or northwest Pittsburgh (Chartiers, Esplen, Fairywood, Windgap). This makes intuitive sense to me; the farther away from downtown they are, the less traffic they get, and the less likely to have high crime rates. \n",

    "* Western and southwestern Pittsburgh features Ridgemont, East Carnegie, Oakwood. This is interesting considering that many of the highest crime neighborhoods are also found in southwestern Pittsburgh. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Polish Hill, despite being pretty close to downtown, separated only by the Strip and Hill Districts, has experienced relatively little crime recently. Originally home to Polish immigrants and later thei descendants, it sounds about right that it is safe. Although immigrants get a bad rap when it comes to crime, these immigrants are hard working, dedicated individuals who would rather not sacrifice their shot at the \"American Dream\" and disregard or throw away the hardship their ancestors endured to get there in the first place.
