Calvin's Information:
Dataset: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data
This dataset contains all of the UCR reported crimes that have occurred in Pittsburgh since 2016. The spreadsheet includes neighborhood, location, time, what the offense was, and other miscellaneous data that was not needed or is too obscure. 

What is the best neighborhood?
Based on solely my data, the best neighborhood is Troy Hill-Herrs Island. Ola and Matthew, add your conclusion here. vv
